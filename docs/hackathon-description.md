ElevenLabs Global Hackathon Handbook
One Night. Thirty Cities. Building the Future of Conversation.
Welcome to the ElevenLabs Global Hackathon, powered by AI Tinkerers. You’re joining builders across 30 cities worldwide to explore the frontier of Conversational Agents — systems that can speak, listen, and collaborate as naturally as we do.
This guide will help you navigate the evening, understand what’s expected, and get inspired for what to build.

Goals
Push the boundaries of what’s possible in conversational AI.
Build and demo a running project — not slides, not mockups.
Experiment with tools from ElevenLabs and partner sponsors to create new ways humans and AI communicate.
Connect with other top-tier builders in your city and beyond.
Theme: Conversational Agents
Your mission: build something that talks back — and means it.

Turn browsers, voices, and APIs into agents that act on intent, respond in real-time, and evolve through interaction.
Some starting points:
Voice-to-voice or multimodal agents that listen, reason, and respond.
Real-world assistants that combine voice, vision, and action.
Tools that help creators, educators, or teams collaborate with AI voices.
Experiments that push conversation beyond text — ambient, embodied, or emotional interfaces.
The only limit is your imagination (and the four-hour clock).

If you’d like some further inspiration for projects or ways to get started, check out this list of ElevenLabs projects from their showcase. https://showcase.elevenlabs.io/

Getting Started
Bring your laptop, charger, and an open mind. You’ll form a team, build something from scratch, and demo it live by the end of the night.

Team Size: 2 – 4 people
Project Type: New work only — you may use open-source and public APIs, but projects must be built during the hackathon window.
Tech Stack: Anything goes. You’re encouraged (but not required) to build with sponsor technologies — especially if you want to compete for special track prizes.
Collaboration Tools: All participants will receive free access to Miro to brainstorm and map ideas before and during the event.
Check back soon for onboarding links and sponsor API credits.
Tools & Partner Tracks
You’ll have the freedom to use any tools you like — but special prizes are available for the best use of partner technologies, including:

n8n — automation and workflow orchestration
Bolt — rapid backend deployment
BlackBox — AI-powered coding tools
CodeRabbit — AI code review and pair-programming
Clerk — authentication & user management
Check the local event page for updates and partner documentation as they’re released.
Judging
Each city will have its own local judges who select top teams. Local winners will automatically advance to the global finalist pool, judged by an international panel including the ElevenLabs founders and partners.

Global Prizes

🎖️ Special Awards: Best use of n8n · Bolt · BlackBox · CodeRabbit · Clerk

Submission Requirements
Submit a GitHub link including all relevant code and a README describing your build and setup.
A short demo video (≤ 2 minutes) is strongly encouraged — it helps judges and the global audience understand your work.
Make sure your repo clearly notes any open-source tools or APIs used.
Only work done during the hackathon will be considered.
Rules
All participants must attend in person — no remote entries.
Projects must be created from scratch during the event window.
Teams must consist of 2–4 builders.
You own all IP created during the hackathon.
You may use open-source libraries and publicly available APIs, including those from sponsors.
Any projects using private or pre-existing code must clearly document what was pre-built.
Code of Conduct
We’re committed to maintaining a welcoming, inclusive, and builder-focused environment across all cities.
Please:

Treat all participants with respect and professionalism.
Work collaboratively — share, learn, and help others build.
Avoid harassment, discrimination, or disruptive behavior of any kind.
Follow sponsor platform policies and venue guidelines.
Violations may result in removal from the event. If you experience or witness behavior that violates this policy, please find an organizer or report it immediately.
Media & Recording
Photos and video may be taken during the event. By attending, you consent to appear in event photography or social media coverage. If you need a photo removed, please contact your local organizer after the event.

Questions & Support
Ask questions, get technical help, connected with fellow builders, and share your progress on the event message board
Final Thoughts
Across 30 cities, thousands of voices will build, speak, and create in sync. This night isn’t about competition — it’s about discovery.
We’re at the dawn of a new interface for human creativity: one where conversation itself becomes code. Let’s build the systems that make that future possible.
See you on December 11.
Let’s make AI talk back.

 Judging Criteria
These are the judging criteria we’ll use to evaluate projects:

Criterion	What Judges Look For	Scoring (1‑5)
Working Prototype	The submission must run end‑to‑end and demonstrate the agent’s core functionality.	1) Code does not run at all.
2) Major crashes or missing core features.
3) Partial functionality, major bugs remain.
4) Mostly stable with minor bugs.
5) Fully functional, polished, and ready for demo.
Technical Complexity & Integration	Depth of AI/LLM usage, tool‑use APIs, multimodal handling, and seamless integration of browser, voice, cloud, or tool agents.	1) Simple static mock‑up.
2) Basic API call without real‑time interaction.
3) Moderate use of one modality (e.g., only voice).
4) Sophisticated multi‑modal integration (e.g., browser + voice).
5) Advanced orchestration across several agents with robust error handling and real‑world data pipelines.
Innovation & Creativity	Novelty of the agent concept, clever problem framing, and original solution design.	1) Replicates an existing demo.
2) Minor tweak of known idea.
3) Useful but not surprising.
4) Creative twist or new application of known tech.
5) Groundbreaking agent that opens a new use‑case or paradigm.
Real‑World Impact	Potential to solve a tangible problem, user value, scalability, and deployment readiness.	1) Purely academic or toy example.
2) Interesting but limited user relevance.
3) Solves a niche need.
4) Addresses a clear market or social need.
5) Demonstrates life‑changing or large‑scale impact potential (e.g., accessibility, productivity gains).
Theme Alignment	How well the project embodies the hackathon’s focus on conversational agents.	1) Barely related to agents (e.g., generic UI)
2) Superficial mention of agents without functional demo.
3) Agent that uses one partner technology but ignores all other.
4) Clear multi‑agent implementation that showcases at least two partner technologies.
5) Exemplifies the theme perfectly, integrating conversational agents into a cohesive autonomous assistant.
